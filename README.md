# ProjectMatrix

## This is a simple js 'app' that mimics the green code-fall from the movie Matrix.

The base is an HTML file, in there I'm using a canvas to draw the code with js script.

There are 2 version of the app.

####### Version 1:
With separate HTML and .js file
The HTML file is the "Matrix.html" and the script is in the "Matrix.js" file.

####### Version 2:
With only one HTML file: "MatrixCodeFall.html"
In this case the code was written in the HTML file to be simple and easily testable.
